Bundesliga - Tour 21 Stadium: Borussia Park (Monchengladbach) Referee: Tobias Welz One of the matches of the 21st round of the German Bundesliga will be the duel between Gladbach and Bayern, one of the central matches of the reporting game day. Borussia Dortmund had a week to prepare for the game, while the Munich side had a difficult Champions League match against PSG in the mid-week. Despite the workload of the Bavarians, the bookmakers consider the guests to be the big favorites of the match. In the last five games in the Bundesliga, Borussia scored only four points, losing three times: Bayer, Augsburg and Hertha. Naturally, such results could not have a positive impact on the standings of the Stallions. By the reporting game, Borussia slipped to 10th place, inferior to Eintracht, located in the European Cup zone, by 9 points and is unlikely to be able to compete with the strongest teams for a place in the top 6. At the same time, the departure from the German elite does not threaten the Stallions. Borussia's home statistics are seventh in the division, +6=1-3, 22:13 goal difference. On Valentine's Day, Bayern defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1-0, taking a huge step towards the quarter-finals of the Champions League. In general, the Reds have a 4-match winning streak, apart from the victory in Paris in the Bundesliga over Bochum and Wolfsburg, as well as the defeat of Mainz in the German Cup. In the standings of the German championship, "Bavaria" is in the lead, but "on the tail" of the southerners hangs the capital "Union", which is only one point behind the champion. So there is no time for Bayern to relax, they need to win, otherwise the leadership may be lost. Bayern's away statistics are the best in the division, +6=3-1, 28:10 goal difference and 21 points scored. Borussia: Omlin - Scully, Itakura, Elvedi, Bensebini - Stindl, Kone, Kramer, Weigl, Hofmann - Thuram. Bavaria: Sommer - Pawar, Ligt, Upamecano, Canselo - Kimmich - Coman, Musiala, Müller, Sane - Chupo-Motin. Borussia Dortmund have not lost to Bayern in their last five personal meetings. Bet 1X for 3.10. Bayern have won their last four matches. Win2 bet for 1.41. Bayern have not conceded in the last two games. HTM1 rate (0.5) for 2.80. Borussia has recently become an uncomfortable opponent for Bayern, for example, the match of the first round of the BL between the teams ended in a 1-1 draw. However, this fact will only further motivate the Reds to win over the Stallions. If in the last round the Berlin Hertha, one of the main outsiders of the tournament, was able to score against Borussia four times, then it’s scary to imagine how much Bayern could potentially score against Gladbach. We have no doubts about the victory of Bayern in the match of the 21st round and we hope that the upcoming game will turn out to be rich in goals. We offer the following betting options for the match Borussia M - Bayern:
