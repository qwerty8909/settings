Hockey observer Maxim Lebedev gave a prediction for the regular season match between Spartak and Metallurg. Bet: Metallurg to win the match for 1.81. Spartak and Magnitogorsk are now similar to each other in that their desires do not coincide with their capabilities. There is no more similarity, since for the Urals this discrepancy takes place in the middle of the playoff zone of the Eastern Conference, and for the red-whites - in the sub-plinth space of the Western Conference. In theory, “Spartak” has nowhere to go, and he must bite into the “Magnitogorsk” with his teeth and claws. But this does not mean at all that the red-whites will do just that. True, this is compensated by the fact that Magnitogorsk itself is thrown out of the fire and into the frying pan, and the victory over SKA is replaced by a defeat from Neftekhimik. In principle, now the adequacy in the results of the Urals has become much greater than it was a month ago. But not yet enough to be sure even in the match with Spartak. Given the above, I predict a grassroots match with a total not exceeding 6.5. As a result of this battle, Magnitogorsk should gain two points. At the same time, it can easily play out to overtime and to a series of post-match shootouts, ”said Lebedev.
The game day program of the KHL regular season will continue with the confrontation between Spartak and Metallurg. The game will take place on February 20 at 19:30 Moscow time at the Megasport Arena. Our portal also offers its own version of the forecast for this game. In the new season, Muscovites do not always look confident, they lack stability and reliability at their gates, because Spartak is only in the sixth line of the Western conference. Muscovites in the last fights again began to fail, having problems in defense, they started losing again, which worsens the chances of getting into the playoffs. So in the last match, Muscovites lost at home to Severstal with a score of 1:3. Despite the successful selection and competent transfers, which significantly strengthened the team, Metallurg failed to start the championship, but after that the leaders began to get in shape, which allowed the Foxes to regularly get points. Since the new year, the team has plunged into a crisis, rarely wins, but still guaranteed a place in the playoffs. In the last match at home, the "foxes" beat "Sochi" with a score of 4:2. Metallurg looks like a small favorite in this confrontation, the team has a stronger line-up and has been showing good hockey this season. The hosts now have a good segment, but still lacks reliability in defense. I think we are waiting for a draw here in regular time.

KHL - 1 On February 20, 2023, the next regular season match of the regular season Fonbet KHL Spartak - Metallurg will be held on the ice of the Megasport arena, which was prepared by the editors of Metaratings. The meeting is scheduled to start at 19:30 Moscow time. Spartak continues to make every effort to fly past the playoffs. Two and a half months ago, it was hard to imagine that the "red-whites" would not be able to break into the cup battles. Then Igor Grishin just came to the post of head coach and immediately gave out a long winning streak. Alas, since then the results of the Muscovites have declined sharply, the mentor was fired, and the acting helmsman Alexei Zavarukhin cannot get anything from the wards. In the last ten games, Spartak suffered eight defeats, which is why it remains only in ninth place in the Western Conference standings, and the chances of top 8 are minimal. Metallurg is still far from its best examples, however, the Urals have long secured their way into the playoffs, so the pressure on them is not so great. At the end of the regular season, Magnitogorsk are fighting only for a higher seeding before the cup battles in order to play more games at home. The day before, the wards of Ilya Vorobyov with huge problems beat the main outsider of the league HC Sochi - 4:2, although by the middle of the meeting they were losing - 0:2. This local success allowed Metallurg to rise to fifth place in the Eastern Conference standings, and in terms of lost points, the steelworkers are second. It remains to collect them. Spartak: Rybar, Emelin - Keane, Khokhlachov - Varone - Prince. Metallurg: Pasquale, Zemchenok - Yakovlev, Koshelev - Burmistrov - Chibisov. Metallurg is one of the most uncomfortable opponents for Spartak in recent years. Suffice it to say that in the entire 27-match history of the confrontation in the KHL, the Red-Whites won only five times (19%). And now the Muscovites are approaching the game with the Urals, being in a disgusting form, which is why they lost in eight out of ten previous meetings. Yes, Magnitogorsk also has enough game problems, but they still look more solid and often cling to points. Gradually, Alexei Zavarukhin's wards are losing hope of reaching the playoffs, which the Steelworkers should use, and you can bet on the victory of Metallurg in the match with a coefficient of 1.80.
